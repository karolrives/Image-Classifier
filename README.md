# ImageClassifier

Implemented a convolutional neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Installation

There is no necessary libraries to run the code, except the ones included in the Jupyter Notebook. The code runs with no issues using Python 3 or newer versions.

## Project Motivation

This project was part of the Data Science Udacity Program and needed to be completed in order to obtain a certificate.

## Results

The main findings are found in the Jupyter Notebook **Image Classifier Project_Final.ipynb**, where markdown cells were used to walk through all the steps.
